# Wazuh-IDS-lab
Intrusion detection and active response

Project Description

This project demonstrates the endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities of Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring platform. The Wazuh server and dashboard are installed on Kali Linux (VMware), while a Wazuh agent is deployed on Ubuntu (VMware) to monitor system activities.
To test the setup, a Hydra brute force attack is launched from Kali against the Ubuntu machine, and Wazuh successfully detects the intrusion attempts in real time.
