# Wazuh-IDS-lab
Intrusion detection and active response

Project Description

This project demonstrates the endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities of Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring platform. The Wazuh server and dashboard are installed on Kali Linux (VMware), while a Wazuh agent is deployed on Ubuntu (VMware) to monitor system activities.
To test the setup, a Hydra brute force attack is launched from Kali against the Ubuntu machine, and Wazuh successfully detects the intrusion attempts in real time.

Setup

1- Setting up Ubuntu on VMware
Ubuntu will act as the agent machine in our project. First, we need to install Ubuntu on VMware.
Steps:
2. Download Ubuntu ISO
  Download the Ubuntu Desktop ISO 
  ðŸ‘‰ https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=24.04.3&architecture=amd64&lts=true

3.Open VMware Workstation / Player
 - Click on Create a New Virtual Machine.
 - Select Installer disc image (ISO) and browse the downloaded Ubuntu ISO.

 4.Configure VM Settings
-Name the VM (e.g., Ubuntu-Agent).
-Allocate at least:

 2GB RAM (better 4 GB)
-2 CPUs
-25 GB Disk Space

 4.Install Ubuntu
-Start the VM and follow on-screen instructions.
-Choose Normal Installation.
-Set up your username and password 

Post-Installation Setup
-Once Ubuntu boots up, update the system:
-sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install VMware Tools (for smooth clipboard & resolution).
âœ… Now Ubuntu is ready as the agent machine, where we will install the Wazuh agent later.

STEP 1 - Installing Wazuh 

1: Update Kali
-sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2: Download and run Wazuh installation assistant
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a

3: Wait for setup to finish. At the end, it will show:
INFO: --- Summary ---
INFO: You can access the web interface https://<KALI_IP>
      User: admin
      Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
INFO: Installation finished.

Step 4: Open browser in Kali â†’ Go to
https://<KALI_IP>

STEP-2  ( Installing Wazuh Agent on Ubuntu VM )

 From the Wazuh GUI interface, proceed to Agents > Deploy new agents

Next, select the correct architecture and Wazuh server address.

Next, you will be presented with commands to download, install, and start the Wazuh agent. Copy the commands and run them in the Ubuntu Server you just installed.

After installing and starting the wazuh agent, check the status to make sure it is active.

From the Wazuh Gui interface, youâ€™ll see that a new agent has been added.

Step 3: Perform SSH brute force attack from Kali

We will use Hydra to perform the brute force attack. Hydra is a popular and versatile password-cracking tool that supports various protocols for online attacks. Hydra supports a multitude of protocols, including SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, Telnet, and many more. This versatility allows security professionals to test various services and applications.

hydra -l <Username> -P <password_list.txt> <Ubuntu_Server_IP_Address> ssh

Visualize alerts
From the Wazuh interface we can visualize the alerts of the brute force attack.
